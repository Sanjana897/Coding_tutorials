1. Take the sentence: All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy. Store each 
   word in a separate variable, then print out the sentence on one line using
   print.

7. You look at the clock and it is exactly 2pm. You set an alarm to go off in 
   51 hours. At what time does the alarm go off? (Hint: you could count on 
   your fingers, but this is not what weâ€™re after. If you are tempted to count
   on your fingers, change the 51 to 5100.) 

   * Use an expression consisting of Python values and operators
   * Use a 24 hour clock ... so start off by thinking of 2pm as 14 (no need
     to add am or pm)  
   * Hint: consider using modulo
